# URLcompress
Project requirements/ desired functionality:

- Allow the user to input a long URL and then receive a generated short, unique code for the URL (Initial question: how long should the short code be?)
- The application should store the long URL and corresponding short code mapping in a database
- When given the short code, the URL shortener application should be able to look up the corresponding long URL in the database and redirect users to the appropriate site
